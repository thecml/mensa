# MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis under Informative Censoring

MENSA is a novel, deep-learning model for multi-event survival analysis. Given an instance, a multi-event survival model predicts the time until that instance experiences each of several different events. These events are not mutually exclusive and there are often statistical dependencies between them. MENSA works by jointly learning the K event distributions as a convex combination of Weibull distributions. This approach leverages mutual information between events that may be lost in models that assume independence. MENSA does also support single-event and competing risks scenarios by treating the censoring distribution as just another event. This allows predicting if a patient will likely experience the event of interest or be censored, e.g., drop out of the study or be event-free at its termination.
